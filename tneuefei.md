Hi, I'm Thomas Neuefeind. I'm a senior in Computer Science, minoring in machine learning.
In the past I've studied Psychology and Neuroscience, and am still interested in applying data analytics and machine learning in those domains.
Currently, I work in the TENN Lab at UT where I am building a software model of a processor, based on a particular neuron model.
I also enjoy coffee, hiking, and soccer outside of work and school.
